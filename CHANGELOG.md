## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Unified `ferrum` CLI with subcommands** (`src/cli/`, `src/main.rs`, `Cargo.toml`)
  - The project now ships a single `ferrum` binary (renamed from `ferrum-engine`) with three
    subcommands dispatched via `clap`:
  - `ferrum serve` — start the OpenAI-compatible HTTP server. Accepts all previous flags plus
    `--system-prompt <text>` (injected as the first system message if not already present) and
    `--json-logs`. Logic extracted from `main.rs` into `src/cli/serve.rs`.
  - `ferrum run <prompt>` — single-shot terminal inference: loads the model, runs prefill +
    decode, streams tokens to stdout, then exits. Useful for quick one-off queries without
    running a server. Flags: `--model-path`, `--temperature`, `--top-p`, `--top-k`,
    `--repetition-penalty`, `--seed`, `--max-new-tokens`, `--system-prompt`,
    `--no-system-prompt`, `--ctx-len`, `--gpu-memory-fraction`, `--verbose`.
    Implemented in `src/cli/run.rs`.
  - `ferrum pull <model-id>` — download a GGUF model from HuggingFace Hub. Fetches the model
    file list from the Hub API, presents an interactive selector when multiple GGUF files are
    found (`dialoguer`), downloads with a live progress bar (`indicatif`), and saves to
    `--output-dir` (default: `./models/`). Supports `--hf-token` for private repositories.
    Implemented in `src/cli/pull.rs`.
  - `src/config.rs` deleted; all configuration is now owned by the CLI arg structs.
  - New dependencies: `indicatif = "0.17"`, `dialoguer = "0.11"`.

- **Configurable system prompt for the HTTP server** (`src/api/routes.rs`)
  - `AppState` struct introduced to hold `Arc<InferenceEngine>` + `Option<String>` system
    prompt. `router()` now takes the prompt as a parameter and injects it into every
    `chat/completions` request that doesn't already have a system message.

- **13 sampler unit tests** (`src/engine/model.rs`)
  - `sample_greedy`: argmax correctness, single-token input, tie-breaking behaviour.
  - `apply_repetition_penalty`: positive/negative logit cases, no-op on empty history,
    out-of-range token IDs.
  - `sample_token`: greedy path at temperature ≤ 0, seeded reproducibility, top-K candidate
    restriction (50-sample Monte Carlo), top-P nucleus restriction (dominant token always
    sampled), repetition penalty overrides raw logit ranking.

### Fixed

- **KV cache positional gap on hybrid/recurrent models** (`src/scheduler/batch.rs`, `src/scheduler/mod.rs`, `src/engine/model.rs`, `src/engine/mod.rs`)
  - When a prefix-cache hit was used, the decode step was starting at position
    `prompt_tokens.len() + generated_tokens` instead of the number of tokens actually
    submitted to llama.cpp. For models with a recurrent memory backend (Qwen3.5, Mamba)
    this caused `find_slot: non-consecutive token position` warnings and incoherent output.
  - Fix: added `prefilled_tokens: usize` to `InferenceRequest` (initialised to 0). After
    prefill, `InferenceEngine::run_prefill` calls `Scheduler::set_prefilled_tokens` with the
    actual count. `context_len()` returns `prefilled_tokens + generated_tokens` once set,
    falling back to `prompt_tokens.len()` only before prefill completes.
  - `Model::prefill_sync` / `LlamaCppModel::do_prefill` return type extended from
    `Vec<(u64, Logits)>` to `Vec<(u64, Logits, usize)>` (third element is `tokens_submitted`).

- **Graceful recovery on KV cache exhaustion** (`src/engine/mod.rs`)
  - `llama_decode` returning a non-zero error code (e.g. `init_batch: failed to prepare
    attention ubatches` / `decode: failed to find a memory slot`) previously propagated as a
    hard `anyhow::Error` and crashed the engine loop.
  - `run_prefill` and `run_decode` errors are now caught with `match`; affected requests are
    marked `StopReason::Length` and the engine loop continues. Subsequent requests are
    unaffected.

- **Stale `stop_reason` on preempted-request re-admission** (`src/scheduler/mod.rs`)
  - When a request was LIFO-preempted its `stop_reason` was set to `Some(Preempt)`. On
    re-admission to `Prefilling` the field was never cleared, so the engine could see a
    non-`None` stop reason on a still-active request.
  - Fix: `schedule_step` now sets `req.stop_reason = None` in both the prefix-cache-hit and
    normal admission paths before transitioning to `Prefilling`.

- **CUDA build with non-standard CUDA installations** (`build.rs`)
  - Removed the hard `CUDA_PATH` env-var requirement. `build.rs` now locates `nvcc` via
    `which nvcc`, falling back to `$CUDACXX` and then `/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc`. The
    resolved path is passed to CMake as `CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER`; the parent directory is used
    to derive the CUDA library search paths.

### Changed

- **`ahash` replaces `DefaultHasher` for token hashing** (`src/scheduler/mod.rs`)
  - `hash_tokens` now uses `ahash::AHasher` (initialised from a process-stable
    `OnceLock<ahash::RandomState>`). Faster with better avalanche properties; still
    deterministic within a single run. Dependency added: `ahash = "0.8"`.

- **Prefix cache backed by `lru::LruCache`** (`src/scheduler/mod.rs`)
  - `HashMap<u64, PrefixCacheEntry>` replaced with `lru::LruCache<u64, PrefixCacheEntry>`.
    The LRU ordering is preserved in preparation for future automatic eviction (currently the
    manual capacity check is kept to avoid silent block leaks until the eviction path is
    wired through properly). Dependency added: `lru = "0.12"`.

- `src/config.rs` deleted; server configuration now lives in `src/cli/serve.rs::ServeArgs`.
- `src/api/mod.rs` now re-exports `AppState` alongside `router`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- **Crash on hybrid/recurrent models** (`src/engine/model.rs`, `src/engine/mod.rs`)
  - Qwen3.5, Mamba, and other hybrid architectures use `llama_memory_recurrent` instead of
    the standard attention KV cache. Calling `llama_memory_seq_cp` on those models triggered
    `GGML_ASSERT(is_full && "seq_cp() is only supported for full KV buffers")` inside
    llama.cpp, terminating the process with `SIGABRT` on the second request with an identical
    prompt.
  - Added `Model::supports_seq_copy()` backed by `llama_memory_can_shift()`: returns `true`
    only for full KV cache backends (standard attention-only transformers).
  - `InferenceEngine::new()` stores the result as `supports_prefix_cache` and logs it at
    startup.
  - `do_prefill` now guards `llama_memory_seq_cp` with a `can_shift` check as a second safety
    net.
  - Prefix caching is automatically disabled for incompatible models; all other features
    (stop sequences, metrics, streaming usage) remain fully functional.

- **CUDA build** (`build.rs`, `Cargo.toml`)
  - Removed the optional `cudarc` dependency (only used to query GPU memory, but its
    `build.rs` requires a CUDA-version feature flag that caused `--features cuda` to fail with
    a compile error). Replaced with a `nvidia-smi` subprocess call — no extra dependencies.
  - `build.rs` now links `ggml-cuda`, `libcuda` (driver API), `libcudart`, `libcublas`, and
    `libcublasLt`, searching both `/cuda/lib64` and `/cuda/targets/x86_64-linux/lib` to
    support different CUDA installation layouts.

- **Prefix-cache boundary token position** (`src/engine/model.rs`)
  - `do_prefill` was copying positions `0..skip_prefix_tokens` via `seq_cp` and then
    submitting the last prompt token at the wrong position (`context_len` instead of
    `skip_prefix_tokens - 1`). Changed to copy `0..skip_prefix_tokens-1` and always
    re-submit the boundary token in the batch at the correct position, ensuring valid
    positional encodings and correct logits.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **PageTable — explicit logical→physical block mapping** (`src/kv_cache/mod.rs`)
  - Replaced the flat `kv_block_ids: Vec<BlockId>` field in `InferenceRequest` with a named
    `PageTable` struct. The struct encapsulates the `entries` vector
    (`logical_block_index → physical_block_id`) and exposes `block_ids()`, `len()`,
    `is_empty()`, `clear()`, and `extend()`.
  - Added `ref_count: Vec<AtomicUsize>` to `KVCacheManager` (one entry per physical block).
    `allocate` sets `ref_count = 1`; `free_blocks` decrements and only returns the block to the
    free list when the count reaches zero.
  - `retain_block(id)` — increments ref_count (used when a block is shared for prefix caching).
  - `copy_on_write(id) -> Option<BlockId>` — allocates a new exclusive block and decrements the
    shared one's ref_count; foundational for future true memory-sharing CoW.

- **Prefix caching — skip re-prefill for identical prompts** (`src/scheduler/mod.rs`, `src/engine/mod.rs`, `src/engine/model.rs`)
  - `Scheduler` now embeds a `PrefixCache: HashMap<u64, PrefixCacheEntry>` keyed by
    `hash(prompt_tokens)`. Max capacity = `max_batch_size / 4` entries.
  - When a request finishes (EOS, Length, or StopSequence), `InferenceEngine` calls
    `Scheduler::try_insert_prefix` which atomically transfers the request's `kv_seq_id` and
    `page_table` blocks into the cache (the KV data in llama.cpp is preserved — `clear_sequence`
    is skipped for cached entries).
  - On the next admission of a request with the same prompt hash, `schedule_step` detects the
    hit, transfers the cached blocks to the new request's `PageTable`, allocates only the
    generation blocks, sets `skip_prefix_tokens` and `prefix_seq_id` on the request.
  - `do_prefill` calls `llama_memory_seq_cp(mem, prefix_seq_id, new_seq_id, 0, skip_tokens)`
    inside the blocking task before building the batch, then submits only
    `prompt_tokens[skip_prefix_tokens..]` starting at the correct absolute position.
    After prefill, the engine clears the now-redundant prefix sequence and returns its ID to
    the pool via `Scheduler::return_prefix_seq_id`.
  - New `Model` trait method: `copy_sequence_range(src, dst, token_count)`, backed by
    `llama_memory_seq_cp`; no-op in the stub.
  - Counters `prefix_hits` / `prefix_misses` (atomic) on `Scheduler`; exposed on `InferenceEngine`.

- **Stop sequences** (`src/scheduler/batch.rs`, `src/engine/mod.rs`, `src/api/types.rs`)
  - `SamplingParams` gains `stop: Option<Vec<String>>`.
  - `ChatCompletionRequest.stop` accepts both a JSON string and an array (OpenAI spec). Uses a
    custom `deserialize_stop` Serde helper.
  - `StopReason::StopSequence` variant added.
  - `handle_logits` now runs a rolling-buffer stop-sequence check (last `2 × max_stop_len` chars)
    per request. The stop string is **not** emitted in the output; only the prefix before the
    match is sent to the client (OpenAI behaviour). Detection works across token boundaries.
  - Output filtering (`<think>` suppression, special token stripping) and stop sequence detection
    now share a single lock acquisition on `per_request_state` to prevent deadlocks.

- **Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint** (`src/metrics.rs`, `src/api/routes.rs`, `src/main.rs`)
  - New `GET /metrics` route returning Prometheus text exposition format (version 0.0.4).
  - Metrics registered at startup via `Metrics::new()`:
    - `ferrum_requests_total{finish_reason}` — counter
    - `ferrum_tokens_generated_total` — counter
    - `ferrum_request_latency_seconds` — histogram (10 buckets: 0.05 s … 60 s)
    - `ferrum_kv_cache_usage_ratio` — gauge
    - `ferrum_queue_depth` — gauge
    - `ferrum_active_requests` — gauge
    - `ferrum_prefix_cache_hits_total` — counter
    - `ferrum_prefix_cache_misses_total` — counter
  - Dependency added: `prometheus = "0.14"`.
  - Gauges and counter deltas are refreshed on every engine scheduling step.

- **Streaming `usage` in the final chunk** (`src/api/routes.rs`, `src/api/types.rs`)
  - The last SSE chunk (the one that carries `finish_reason`) now includes a `usage` object
    with `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, and `total_tokens`, matching the OpenAI
    streaming spec. Intermediate chunks omit the field (`skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"`).

### Changed

- `InferenceRequest` fields: `kv_block_ids: Vec<BlockId>` → `page_table: PageTable`;
  new fields `skip_prefix_tokens: usize`, `prefix_seq_id: Option<i32>`,
  `submitted_at: Instant` (for latency metrics).
- `InferenceEngine::new` now accepts `metrics: Option<Arc<Metrics>>`.
- `OutputFilterState` renamed to `PerRequestState`; its `text_buffer` field drives stop
  sequence detection.
- `PLAN.md` updated: Phase 1 marked completed with v0.1.0/v0.2.0 summaries; Phase 2
  progress tracked.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Real stochastic sampling** (`src/engine/model.rs`)
  - Replaced the deterministic `sample_top_p` (which always returned the same
    token for identical logits) with a weighted random draw from the nucleus.
  - New pipeline per token: repetition penalty → temperature scaling →
    top-K masking → softmax → top-P nucleus truncation → weighted random sample.
  - Added `top_k: u32` (0 = disabled) and `repetition_penalty: f32` (1.0 =
    disabled) parameters — surfaced in `SamplingParams`, `InferenceRequest`,
    `InferenceRequestForModel`, and the OpenAI request types.
  - Added `seed: Option<u64>` for reproducible output: when set, each token
    position uses `StdRng::seed_from_u64(seed ^ token_count)`.
  - Scheduler now tracks `generated_token_ids` per request for repetition
    penalty without storing the full history in the model.
  - Dependency added: `rand = "0.8"`.

- **Docker support**
  - `Dockerfile` — multi-stage build (Rust 1.84 builder + `debian:bookworm-slim`
    runtime); ships both `ferrum-engine` and `ferrum-bench`.
  - `docker-compose.yml` — mounts a local `./models` volume; optional NVIDIA
    GPU passthrough via commented `deploy.resources` section.
  - `.dockerignore` — excludes `target/`, `models/`, `.git/`, editors.
  - `README.md` updated with a new **Docker** section.
  - `Makefile` new targets: `docker` and `docker-run`.

- **Integrated benchmark binary** (`src/bin/bench.rs` → `ferrum-bench`)
  - Launches N concurrent workers, each sending `--requests` SSE chat
    completions to the target server.
  - Reports **TTFT** (P50/P95), **total latency** (P50/P95/P99), aggregate
    **tokens/second**, and total elapsed time.
  - CLI: `--url`, `--model`, `--concurrency`, `--requests`, `--prompt`,
    `--max-tokens`.
  - Dependency added: `reqwest = "0.12"` with `json` + `stream` features.
  - `Makefile` new target: `bench` (configurable via `BENCH_CONCURRENCY`,
    `BENCH_REQUESTS`, `BENCH_PROMPT`, `BENCH_MAX_TOKENS`).
  - `README.md` updated with a new **Benchmark** section.

### Fixed

- **`llama_decode` crash: "non-consecutive token position" / "inconsistent sequence positions"**
  — Two related bugs caused `llama_decode` to return `-1` and kill the engine loop
  when more than one request was ever processed:
  1. **Unstable `seq_id`** — each request was assigned `seq_id = its_index_in_the_current_batch`.
     A request prefilled as `seq_id=0` would end up as `seq_id=1` in the next decode batch
     (if another request joined), so llama.cpp looked up the wrong KV/recurrent-memory slot.
     Fix: each request is now assigned a stable `kv_seq_id` from a pool
     (`0..max_batch_size`) at admission time; the ID does not change until the request
     finishes or is preempted.
  2. **Stale KV state on seq_id reuse** — when a request ended or was LIFO-preempted its
     seq_id was returned to the pool but the llama.cpp memory module still held all its
     cached positions. The next request that received that ID would submit tokens at
     position 0 while the context still recorded the previous occupant's last position
     (e.g. 55), causing an M-RoPE position assertion failure.
     Fix: `Model::clear_sequence(seq_id)` — backed by `llama_memory_seq_rm(mem, seq_id, 0, -1)`
     — is now called (a) in `handle_logits` when a request finishes and (b) in `run_loop`
     for every `seq_id` in `ScheduledBatch::preempted_seq_ids`, before those IDs can be
     handed to a new request.

### Changed

- `SamplingParams` struct introduced in `scheduler/batch.rs` to group all
  sampling hyper-parameters; `InferenceRequest::new` now accepts it instead of
  individual `temperature`/`top_p` arguments.
- `ChatCompletionRequest` in `api/types.rs` exposes `top_k`, `repetition_penalty`,
  and `seed` as optional JSON fields, fully forward-compatible with the
  OpenAI spec.
- `ScheduledBatch` now carries a `preempted_seq_ids: Vec<i32>` field so the engine
  can clear stale KV state immediately after preemption.
- `Scheduler::new` now accepts `max_batch_size: usize` to size the seq_id pool.
- `Model` trait gains a new required method: `clear_sequence(&self, seq_id: i32)`.

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-08

Initial release.

  - `GET /health` — KV cache usage, queue depth, active requests
- **Inference engine**
  - llama.cpp FFI backend with GGUF model support
  - Continuous batching scheduler with LIFO preemption
  - Block-based KV-cache memory manager
  - `temperature` and `top_p` sampling wired through the full pipeline (API → scheduler → model)

  - Unified per-token scheduler update (`update_after_token`) — single lock acquisition per token
- **MIT + Apache 2.0 dual license**

### Fixed

- SSE stream now correctly emits `finish_reason: "length"` when `max_tokens` is reached (previously the client would hang waiting for more data)
- Panic on `Event::json_data(...).unwrap()` in the SSE path replaced with a safe fallback
- `CString::new(...).unwrap()` panics when role or content strings contain null bytes in `apply_chat_template`
- Partial special tokens (`<|`) no longer leak into the output stream
- `gpu_memory_fraction` out-of-range values now produce a clear error at startup instead of silently misbehaving

### Changed

- Context length is no longer hardcoded to 2048; controlled via `--max-context-len`
- Removed unused runtime dependencies: `thiserror`, `tokenizers` (HuggingFace)
- `KVCacheManager` debug set (`_allocated_set: Mutex<HashSet<BlockId>>`) removed — eliminated a second mutex acquisition on every allocate/free call
- bindgen warnings from llama.cpp FFI bindings suppressed in `ffi.rs`
